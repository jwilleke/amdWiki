# amdWiki Docker Environment Configuration
# Copy this file to .env and customize as needed

# Host port mapping for Docker
# This is the port on your host machine that maps to the container's internal port
# Change this if port 3000 is already in use
HOST_PORT=3000

# To use a different port, change the value:
# HOST_PORT=8080

# To let Docker auto-assign a random available port, use:
# HOST_PORT=

# Container internal port (should match amdwiki.server.port in config)
# You typically don't need to change this
CONTAINER_PORT=3000

# Node environment
# Determines which config file ConfigurationManager loads:
# - production: loads app-production-config.json
# - development: loads app-development-config.json
# - test: loads app-test-config.json
NODE_ENV=production

# User ID and Group ID for container process
# This ensures files created by the container match your host user permissions
# Default: 1000:1000 (matches the 'node' user in the container)
#
# To find your current user's UID and GID:
#   Linux/macOS: Run `id -u` for UID and `id -g` for GID
#   Or run: echo "UID=$(id -u)" and echo "GID=$(id -g)"
#
# Common values:
#   - First user on Linux: 1000:1000
#   - First user on macOS: 501:20
#   - Root (not recommended): 0:0
UID=1000
GID=1000

# Example: Use your current user (Linux/macOS)
# Run these commands to set dynamically:
#   export UID=$(id -u)
#   export GID=$(id -g)
#   docker-compose up -d

# Example: Run in development mode on port 8080 as current user
# NODE_ENV=development
# HOST_PORT=8080
# UID=501
# GID=20
