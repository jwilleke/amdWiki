# amdWiki Open Pull Request Review Analysis

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive review of all 6 open pull requests in the amdWiki repository. All PRs are addressing the same core issue: **UI layout inconsistency between the Edit textarea and Preview panel heights** (Issue #7).

## Repository Context

**amdWiki** is a JSPWiki-inspired file-based wiki built with Node.js/Express, following a modular manager pattern. The affected functionality is in the page editor UI where users can edit Markdown content with real-time preview.

## Key Technical Issues Identified

### 1. **Redundant Solutions** (Critical)
All 4 functional PRs solve the same problem with different approaches, creating maintenance confusion.

### 2. **node_modules Changes** (Major)
All PRs include massive `node_modules/.package-lock.json` changes (1000+ lines) which should not be committed as they're dependency artifacts.

### 3. **Inconsistent Height Values** (Medium)
Different PRs use different height values (400px, 420px, 480px, 500px) without clear justification.

### 4. **Mixed CSS Approaches** (Medium)
Some use inline CSS, others modify external CSS files - inconsistent with project patterns.
