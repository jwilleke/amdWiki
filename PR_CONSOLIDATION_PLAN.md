# Pull Request Consolidation Plan for amdWiki

## Current Situation
- **6 open pull requests** all addressing Issue #7 (Edit/Preview dialog height mismatch)
- **4 functional solutions** with different technical approaches
- **2 meta-PRs** for review purposes
- All PRs include unnecessary `node_modules/.package-lock.json` changes

## Recommended Action Plan

### Phase 1: Immediate Consolidation

#### 1. Merge PR #9 ✅
**Justification**: Best overall solution
- Only non-draft PR (ready for production)
- Comprehensive flexbox implementation
- Responsive design with mobile support
- Excellent documentation with screenshots
- Updates both template files

#### 2. Close Duplicate PRs
- **PR #10**: Close with comment referencing PR #9 as chosen solution
- **PR #11**: Close with comment referencing PR #9 as chosen solution  
- **PR #12**: Close with comment referencing PR #9 as chosen solution

#### 3. Complete Meta-PRs
- **PR #13**: Complete this analysis and merge
- **PR #14**: Close as duplicate of PR #13

### Phase 2: Clean Up Repository

#### 1. Fix node_modules Issue
```bash
# Remove from tracking
git rm --cached node_modules/.package-lock.json
git commit -m "Remove node_modules from tracking"
```

#### 2. Update Contributing Guidelines
Create `CONTRIBUTING.md` with:
- PR submission guidelines
- Code style requirements
- Testing requirements
- UI/CSS conventions

### Phase 3: Prevent Future Duplicates

#### 1. Issue Templates
Create `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md`:
```markdown
---
name: Bug report
about: Create a report to help us improve
---

**Before submitting**: Please search existing issues and PRs to avoid duplicates.
```

#### 2. PR Templates
Create `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`:
```markdown
