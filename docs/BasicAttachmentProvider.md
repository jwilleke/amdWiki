# BasicAttachmentProvider Planning

All configuration MUST be from src/managers/ConfigurationManager.js

SHOULD follow the basic functionality of <https://github.com/apache/jspwiki/blob/c31d4f284983fd25e37e7ec5682fe2bdfddc439b/jspwiki-main/src/main/java/org/apache/wiki/providers/BasicAttachmentProvider.java>

SHOULD work with <https://github.com/jwilleke/amdWiki/issues/93>

"Attachments" includes images or anything "amdwiki.features.attachments.allowedTypes".

Create a src/managers/BasicAttachmentProvider.js

The current attachment provider is identified by:
"amdwiki.attachment.provider": "BasicAttachmentProvider",

The location to store attachments is is identified by:
"amdwiki.basicAttachmentProvider.storageDir": "./data/attachments",

BasicAttachmentProvider MUST be able to backup() and restore() for src/managers/BackupManager.js

The following entries should be honored: 
- "amdwiki.features.attachments.enabled": true,
- "amdwiki.features.attachments.maxSize": "10MB",
- "amdwiki.features.attachments.allowedTypes": "image/*,text/*,application/pdf", <-- Should be an array of mimetypes -->
- "amdwiki.features.attachments.metadatafile": "./data/attachments/BasicAttachmentProvider.json", (Matches "amdwiki.attachment.provider" name)

## BasicAttachmentProvider.json
In JSPWiki attachments were attached to individual pages but in amdWiki they are stored within a shared folder within the BasicAttachmentProvider.

Which pages attchements are used it tracked within the associated "json" like BasicAttachmentProvider.json.

These "json" files will include:
- Fullpath (including filename) attachement file.
- author - The author of this content or rating. Please note that author is special in that HTML 5 provides a special mechanism for indicating authorship via the rel tag. That is equivalent to this and may be used interchangeably.
- dateCreated - The date on which the CreativeWork was created or the item was added to a DataFeed.
- editor - Specifies the Person who edited or upladed the CreativeWork. (may be same as author)
- dateModified - The date on which the CreativeWork was most recently modified or when the item's entry was modified within a DataFeed.
- encodingFormat - <https://schema.org/encodingFormat>  MUST be MIME format (see [IANA site](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml) and [MDN reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/MIME_types))
- isBasedOn - OPTIONAL - A resource from which this work is derived or from which it is a modification or adaptation. Supersedes isBasedOnUrl.
- isFamilyFriendly - Assumed so unless set to false
- Array of pages using the attachment
- any other values OPTIONAL as used at https://schema.org/CreativeWork


Example of BasicAttachmentProvider.json
``` json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "CreativeWork",
  "name": "Report_2025_Q3_Financials.pdf",
  "description": "Quarterly financial report for Q3 2025, detailing revenue, expenses, and profit margins.",
  "author": {
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "Jane Doe"
  },
  "editor": {
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "John Smith"
  },
  "dateCreated": "2025-10-01T09:00:00Z",
  "dateModified": "2025-10-05T14:30:00Z",
  "encodingFormat": "application/pdf",
  "isFamilyFriendly": true,
  "isBasedOn": {
    "@type": "CreativeWork",
    "name": "Previous Quarter's Financial Report",
    "url": "https://example.com/reports/Q2_2025_Financials.pdf"
  },
  "url": "/attachments/reports/Report_2025_Q3_Financials.pdf",  // Fullpath
  "mentions": [ //Array of pages using the attachment
    {
      "@type": "WebPage",
      "name": "Financial Overview Page",
      "url": "https://example.com/financial-overview"
    },
    {
      "@type": "WebPage",
      "name": "Investor Relations Section",
      "url": "https://example.com/investor-relations"
    }
  ]
}

```

## AttachmentProvider Security
src/managers/AttachmentManager.js MUST use ./managers/PolicyManager' to verify actions to upload or attache to a page.

``` json
Actions (Permssions)
  "attachment:upload",
  "attachment:delete",
```

## Attchment Rendering "link types"
protected static final int ATTACHMENT = 10;   Link to an attachment/file uploaded to the wiki (`<a class="attachment">`).  

### "jspwiki.translatorReader.useAttachmentImage"
the MarkupParser must determine if it is an attachement and use PROP_USEATTACHMENTIMAGE is a static final String property in JSPWiki (`"jspwiki.translatorReader.useAttachmentImage"`). It is used to control whether **attachment info links** in rendered wiki pages include a small attachment image icon.[1]
- Purpose: If this property is set to `true`, any links to attachments (such as file uploads or page attachments) shown in wiki output will have a small image icon appended, marking the item visually as an attachment rather than a simple link.
- Usage:
  - The value is loaded from `jspwiki.properties` (or overridden in custom property files or system properties) into the parser's `m_useAttachmentImage` boolean field.[2]
  - When the parser renders an attachment link, if `m_useAttachmentImage` is `true`, an attachment icon (typically `images/attachment_small.png`) is added near the link in the HTML output.
- Summary: Set **PROP_USEATTACHMENTIMAGE** to `true` in your configuration to display attachment icons next to every rendered attachment info link in JSPWiki.
