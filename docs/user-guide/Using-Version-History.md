## Understanding the History View

The Page History view shows all versions of a page in a table format.

### Version Table Columns

| Column | Description |
| -------- | ------------- |
| **Version** | Version number (e.g., v1, v2, v3) |
| **Date** | When this version was created |
| **Author** | Who made the changes |
| **Change Type** | Type of change (Created, Updated, Restored) |
| **Comment** | Description of what changed |
| **Size** | Content size in KB |
| **Actions** | Buttons to view, compare, or restore |

### Visual Indicators

- **Blue highlight**: Current version (most recent)
- **Green "Current" badge**: Marks the latest version
- **Flag icon** 🚩: Checkpoint version (performance optimization)
- **Compress icon**: Version is compressed to save space
- **Branch icon**: Uses delta storage (diff-based)

### Example History View

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Page History: Main                                    [Back to Page]     │

## Viewing a Specific Version

To view the content of a previous version:

### Steps

1. Navigate to the page's history view
2. Find the version you want to view in the table
3. Click the **👁 View** button for that version
4. A modal window opens showing the version content

### What You'll See

- **Modal title**: "Version X of PageName"
- **Content**: Rendered markdown content as it appeared in that version
- **Close button**: Click to return to the history view

### Notes

- Content is displayed in read-only mode
- Markdown is rendered (not raw source)
- Links and images work as they did in that version
- You cannot edit from the preview modal

---

## Comparing Versions

Compare two versions to see what changed between them.

### Method 1: Quick Compare (Adjacent Versions)

1. Navigate to the page history
2. Click the **⚖️ Compare** button next to any version
3. This compares that version with the previous one

### Method 2: Compare Any Two Versions

1. Navigate to the page history
2. Scroll down to the "Compare Versions" section
3. Select **From:** version from the first dropdown
4. Select **To:** version from the second dropdown
5. Click the **Compare** button

### Understanding the Diff View

The comparison view shows two sections:

#### 1. Version Information Cards

Two side-by-side cards showing:

- **Left (Red)**: Older version metadata
- **Right (Green)**: Newer version metadata

Each card displays:

- Version number
- Date and time created
- Author
- Change type
- Comment

#### 2. Change Summary

Statistics showing:

- **Additions** (green): Lines added
- **Deletions** (red): Lines removed
- **Unchanged** (gray): Lines that stayed the same

Example:

```
Additions: 15 lines
Deletions: 8 lines
Unchanged: 142 lines
```

#### 3. Diff Display

Two viewing modes:

**Unified View** (default):

- Single column showing all content
- Green background: Added lines (+)
- Red background: Deleted lines (-)
- White background: Unchanged lines

**Side-by-Side View**:

- Two columns
- Left column: Old version (deletions in red)
- Right column: New version (additions in green)

### Switching Views

Click the view mode buttons at the top:

- **Unified View**: Traditional diff format
- **Side-by-Side**: Dual-pane comparison

### Tips for Comparing

- Compare consecutive versions to see incremental changes
- Compare v1 with current to see all changes since creation
- Use side-by-side view for large changes
- Use unified view for small, focused changes

## Restoring Previous Versions

Restore a page to a previous version if changes need to be reverted.

### Important Notes

⚠️ **Restoring creates a new version** - it doesn't delete history
⚠️ **You must be logged in** to restore versions
⚠️ **Action is logged** with your username

### Steps to Restore

1. Navigate to the page history
2. Find the version you want to restore to
3. Click the **↩️ Restore** button for that version
4. Review the confirmation dialog:

   ```
   Are you sure you want to restore "PageName" to version X?

   This will create a new version with the content from version X.
   ```

5. Click **OK** to confirm or **Cancel** to abort

### What Happens During Restore

1. Content from the selected version is retrieved
2. A new version is created with that content
3. The new version is marked as "Restored from vX"
4. You are listed as the author of the restore
5. Page history is updated
6. You're returned to the history view

### Example Restore Scenario

**Before restore:**

- v1: Original content
- v2: Bad edit (spam added)
- v3: More spam
- **Current**: v3 (with spam)

**After restoring to v1:**

- v1: Original content
- v2: Bad edit
- v3: More spam
- v4: Original content (restored from v1)
- **Current**: v4 (spam removed)

### Undoing a Restore

If you restore by mistake:

1. View the history again
2. Find the version before the bad edits
3. Restore to that version

## Version Information on Pages

When viewing any page (not in history mode), you may see a version info banner.

### Version Info Banner

Located at the top of the page content, shows:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🔀 Version 5 of 5 | Last edited by admin on Oct 16, 10:30 AM │
│                                          [View History Button] │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**What it tells you:**

- **Current version number**: "Version 5"
- **Total versions**: "of 5"
- **Last editor**: Who made the most recent change
- **When**: Timestamp of last change

**Quick access:**

- Click **View History** to jump to the history view

### When You'll See It

- Only displayed if versioning is enabled
- Only shown for pages with version history
- Hidden on pages without versions

## Tips and Best Practices

### For Readers

1. **Check history when confused**: If content seems wrong, check history to see if it was recently changed
2. **Use compare to understand changes**: See exactly what was added or removed
3. **Bookmark important versions**: Note version numbers of known-good content

### For Editors

1. **Add meaningful comments**: Help others understand your changes
   - ❌ Bad: "Updated"
   - ✅ Good: "Fixed formatting in Requirements section"

2. **Review before saving**: Use the preview feature to avoid creating unnecessary versions

3. **Check history before major edits**: See what others have done recently

4. **Restore carefully**: Make sure you're restoring to the right version

### For Administrators

1. **Configure retention**: Set appropriate `maxVersions` and `retentionDays`
2. **Monitor storage**: Run periodic analytics to track disk usage
3. **Educate users**: Share this guide with your wiki users
4. **Set up backups**: Version history complements but doesn't replace backups

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: How far back does version history go?**
A: Depends on administrator configuration. Default is 50 versions or 365 days, whichever comes first.

**Q: Can I delete a version?**
A: No, individual versions cannot be deleted through the UI. Contact your administrator if you need specific versions removed.

**Q: Does every page have version history?**
A: Only if versioning is enabled. Check with your administrator.

**Q: Can I see who viewed versions?**
A: No, viewing is not tracked. Only edit/restore actions are logged.

### Comparing Versions

**Q: What do the numbers in brackets mean?**
A: Those are line numbers in the unified diff view, helping you locate changes.

**Q: Why can't I compare certain versions?**
A: All versions should be comparable. If you encounter issues, contact your administrator.

**Q: Can I compare non-consecutive versions?**
A: Yes! Use the "Compare Versions" tool at the bottom of the history page.

### Restoring Versions

**Q: Will restoring delete newer versions?**
A: No! Restoring creates a new version with old content. All history is preserved.

**Q: Can I restore if I'm not logged in?**
A: No, you must be authenticated to restore versions.

**Q: What if I restore the wrong version?**
A: Just restore again to the correct version. Each restore creates a new version.

**Q: Can I restore someone else's page?**
A: Depends on your permissions. Check with your administrator about page permissions.

### Technical Questions

**Q: How much storage does version history use?**
A: Typically 10-20% overhead with delta storage and compression enabled. Your administrator can provide specifics.

**Q: Are versions compressed?**
A: Older versions may be compressed to save space. This happens automatically.

**Q: What's a "checkpoint" version?**
A: Periodic full content snapshots (every 10 versions by default) for faster retrieval.

**Q: Can version history be disabled?**
A: Yes, by the administrator. If disabled, pages revert to single-version storage.

### "Page not found" Error

**Cause**: Page or version doesn't exist
**Solution**: Check the page name and version number

### Can't Restore Versions

**Causes**:

1. Not logged in → Log in first
2. No permission → Contact administrator
3. Versioning disabled → Contact administrator

### Diff Viewer Shows Nothing

**Cause**: Versions are identical
**Solution**: This is normal if no changes occurred
