## The 5 things that literally happen every single day in 99 % of businesses
1. Somebody checks email / messages and replies to customers or suppliers  
2. Somebody looks at the bank balance or accounting software  
3. Somebody does the actual work that makes the product/service  
4. Money comes in or goes out (sales, bills, payroll)  
5. Someone posts something or talks to a potential customer  

That’s it. Everything else is just a variation or a bigger version of these 5.

Keep these 10 simple things running smoothly every week and your business stays alive and grows. Neglect any of them for too long and it dies — slowly or quickly.

1. Customer Interations
2. Employee-vendor Interaction
3. Money Interaction as in Money comes in or goes out (Finacil Transaction)

All business have 
- Contact List of persons
- Finacial transations
