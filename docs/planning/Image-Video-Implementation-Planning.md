# Image-Video-Implementation-Planning

## Requirements
Explore an existing open source  "Free" JavaScript Image and Video album that can be integrated into a current Javascript Project.
* Must be able to read EXIF etc attributes from Images.
* Must be able to handle at least 500k of images.
* Must NOT change filesystem structure of images.
* Must NOT import or move images.
* MUST be able to be Self hosted.

## Exploreing

The best open source JavaScript image and video album options for self-hosted, large-scale photo libraries with EXIF support and no forced import or filesystem restructuring are Photoview and Chronoframe. Both are designed with scalability, metadata extraction, and self-hosting as core features, and they are actively developed for such use cases.[1][2]

### Recommended Solutions

#### Chronoframe
* Chronoframe is a modern, self-hosted photo gallery supporting automatic EXIF parsing and smart metadata organization without changing file structure or requiring import/moving of files.[2]
* Features include fast browsing for very large libraries, video support, and grouping by file metadata like capture date, camera model, and GPS location.[2]
* It reads images directly from original folders and only indexes metadata to its own backend, ensuring the folder layout never changes and images stay in place.[2]
* Can scale to hundreds of thousands of images, making it suitable for a 500,000+ image library.[2]

#### Photoview
* Photoview is built for self-hosting and directly reading organized photo folders (does not move or import photos).[1]
* It supports extraction of EXIF metadata and provides easy browsing with large-scale photo organization well supported.[1]
* Its backend enables responsive performance even with very large numbers of files, as it builds thumbnails and metadata indexes without touching original images.[1]
* Installable via Docker or standard Linux packages and easily integrated into JavaScript-centric environments.[1]

### EXIF Extraction Libraries

If only EXIF reading/integration is needed for a custom UI, the exif-js library is a widely-used, pure JavaScript solution that can be integrated into any frontend or backend project, with direct access to EXIF tags from images without uploading or moving files.[3]

* Reads EXIF and IPTC metadata from JPEG and TIFF files.
* Works directly in browser or Node.js, and can be combined with other gallery UIs for true filesystem-level indexing.[3]

### Notable Alternatives

* Lychee and Photonix are also self-hosted and extract EXIF, but may force import or internal organization, especially with their database-driven or asset management models.[4][5]
* ArchiveBox is for archiving whole websites and isn't optimal for media gallery usage.[6]

### Candidate Feature Comparison

| Solution      | EXIF Support | Video Support | Filesystem Safe | Import/Move Needed | Self-hosted | Scale to 500k+ |
|---------------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|--------------------|-------------|---------------|
| Chronoframe   | Yes[2] | Yes[2]   | Yes[2]     | No[2]         | Yes[2] | Yes[2]   |
| Photoview     | Yes[1]  | Limited[1]| Yes[1]      | No[1]          | Yes[1]  | Yes[1]    |
| exif-js lib   | Yes[3]  | No            | Yes[3]      | No[3]          | Yes[3]  | Yes[3]    |
| Lychee        | Yes[4]  | Limited[4]| Partial[4]  | Partial[4]     | Yes[4]  | Not proven    |

### Key Implementation Notes

* Chronoframe and Photoview provide APIs and/or web UIs that can plug in to existing JavaScript projects and utilize indexers for metadata without physically moving images.
* For direct low-level JS access to EXIF, exif-js is plug-and-play.
* Both solutions are Docker-compatible for deployment and easy scaling within home lab or server environments.

These options deliver exactly the combination of self-hosting, EXIF metadata access, video support, and non-invasive library management required for a large-scale, performant JavaScript image/video album project.[3][2][1]
