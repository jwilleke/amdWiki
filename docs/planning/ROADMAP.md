### New Page and editing

* Preview on Right side
* Need to prompt for pagename when creatting a "new-page" and the pagename will be the name of stored file pagename.md

### Macro type Expansion

[JSPWiki](https://jspwiki-wiki.apache.org/Wiki.jsp?page=JSPWikiCorePlugins) use "Plugins" which is what the [ReferringPagesPlugin](https://jspwiki-wiki.apache.org/Wiki.jsp?page=ReferringPagesPlugin) is based on.

The [ReferringPagesPlugin](https://jspwiki-wiki.apache.org/Wiki.jsp?page=ReferringPagesPlugin) should be implemented with options
Parameters

* max=n : How many pages to list. Default is 10. Some pages might create very long lists, so it's a good idea to limit the list size.
* maxwidth=n : Limits the length of the generated links to at most n characters. This should used to keep the LeftMenu or LeftMenuFooter at a manageable width. Default is to not limit the length at all.
* separator='''markup''' : What should be put between the different items. It's WikiMarkup, and by default it's two backslashes (meaning a carriage return, or line break). JesseWilbur: If you want to use something like a "|", you have to put it in single quotes. separator='|'
* page="page name"
* before="markup"
* after="markup"
* show=pages|count : This parameter can have two values, "pages" (the default), and "count". The value "pages" will give you the list containing the pages, the value "count" will give you just the number of pages, not the whole list.
* showLastModified=true|false : The showLastModified parameter gives you the last modified date/time of the most recently changed page. It is only valid if show="count", otherwise a PluginException is thrown.

[WikiVariable](https://jspwiki-wiki.apache.org/Wiki.jsp?page=WikiVariable) is what used for [{$pagename}]

* [{$pagename}] simply expands the Title of the current page.
* applicationname - is the name of this wiki
* totalpages - The total number of pages available in this Wiki.
* uptime - Inserts the amount of time since this Wiki has been last restarted.
* username - Inserts the current user name: For example, you are now logged in as 174.105.183.192.
* loginstatus - Shows how the current user has logged in. For example, you are anonymous.

### Plugin Escaping âœ… (Implemented)

JSPWiki-style plugins and system variables support proper escaping:

* âœ… **Code Blocks**: Plugins in ```code blocks``` are NOT expanded
* âœ… **Inline Code**: Plugins in `inline code` are NOT expanded
* âœ… **Escaped Syntax**: Use `[[{$variable}]` (double brackets) to prevent expansion and show literal text

**Examples:**
* Normal: `[{$pagename}]` â†’ expands to page name
* Escaped: `[[{$pagename}]` â†’ shows literal `[{$pagename}]`
* Code: `` `[{$pagename}]` `` â†’ shows literal `[{$pagename}]`

### Configuration

* wiki.conf folder should store configuration data
* wiki.conf/template folder should store templates for pages etc.

### Metadata âœ… (Implemented)

YAML frontmatter is stored at the bottom of each page file and is managed by the system (not directly editable in the editor).

#### UUID âœ… (Implemented)

Each page has a globally unique identifier (UUID v4) assigned at creation time, enabling:
* Page tracking across renames
* Version history correlation
* Link integrity maintenance

#### Hierarchical Keyword and Category Design âœ… (Implemented)

* **Categories** - Array-based categories for multi-classification
  * Stored as `categories: []` in YAML frontmatter
  * Default categories: System, Documentation, Test, General
  * Managed via dropdown in create/edit interface
  * Required: At least one category must be assigned

* **Keywords** - System-generated semantic keywords
  * Auto-generated during indexing (LLM integration ready)
  * Stored as `keywords: []` in metadata
  * Reflect core topics and semantic features
  * Limit: Up to 3 keywords per page

* **User-Keywords** - User-defined tags
  * Custom tags added by editors
  * Stored as `user-keywords: []` in metadata
  * Multi-select dropdown interface in editor
  * Limit: Up to 3 user keywords per page
  * Master list maintained in "User Keywords" wiki page

**Category and Keyword Pages:**
* âœ… System foundation pages created (System Keywords, User Keywords)
* âœ… Each category/keyword has a dedicated wiki page
* âœ… Automated link generation and management

### Page Templates

Page Templats are stored in wiki.conf/template folder.

#### Default Page Template

``` markdown
# Overview

[{$pagename}]


### Table Styles

Would like ot support [TablePlugin](https://jspwiki-wiki.apache.org/Wiki.jsp?page=TablePlugin)

Which has several Styles

* [Zebra Table](https://jspwiki-wiki.apache.org/Wiki.jsp?page=Zebra%20Table%20Style)
* [Filtered wiki table](https://jspwiki-wiki.apache.org/Wiki.jsp?page=Filtered%20Tables)
* [Sortable wiki tables](https://jspwiki-wiki.apache.org/Wiki.jsp?page=SortableTables)


### Normal links to other pages

* links [Jims] should be rendered as a link to the existing pagenamed Jims.md. Use a dropdown dialog, hprfully inline with typedoan capabilities.
* Normal Makrdown Links

### Search Features to Support

* Title Search: Map this to the filename minus its extension. Index and expose this as a searchable field.
* Category/Keyword Search: Enable filtering (or faceted search) by assigned category, automatic keywords, and user keywords. 
* Your full-text engine or database (FlexSearch, Elastic, MongoDB full-text, or similar) should allow filtering fields alongside free-text queries.

Full Content Search: Index the entire markdown body for "anywhere" search, possibly returning search scores or highlights for relevance

### Attachments
Attachments should be able to be added as tow different methods.

* inline with text
* Just an Attachments

Attachments thta are NOT Links will be stored wwithin /resources folder.

When they Attachments is "inline with text" we should be able to perform a refresh on loading the page.
