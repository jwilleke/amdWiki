## 🎯 Access Control Enhancement Epic #15

**Goal**: Enhance the current UserManager + ACLManager system with context-aware, policy-based access control

**Current State**: Basic role-based permissions with page-level ACL syntax
**Target State**: Advanced policy-based system with context awareness and audit trails

**Priority**: High
**Status**: In Progress
**Start Date**: September 13, 2025

### 🔄 Current Sprint: Enhanced Audit Trail & Access Logging (#19)

**Sprint Goal**: Implement comprehensive audit trail system for access logging and security monitoring

**Sprint Status**: ✅ Completed
**Start Date**: September 14, 2025
**Actual Completion**: September 14, 2025

**Tasks Completed:**
- ✅ Design audit trail system architecture
- ✅ Implement audit log storage mechanism
- ✅ Integrate audit logging with policy system
- ✅ Build audit log viewer interface
- ✅ Add security monitoring features

### 📊 Progress Metrics

- **Overall Epic**: 71% Complete (5/7 sub-issues)
- **Current Sprint**: ✅ Completed (Enhanced Audit Trail & Access Logging)
- **Sprint Health**: 🟢 EXCELLENT - All tasks completed successfully
- **Estimated Completion**: September 16, 2025 (2 days remaining)
- **Security Status**: 🟢 SECURE - Comprehensive audit trail system implemented
- **Test Coverage**: � COMPREHENSIVE - Audit system tested and validated

### 🚧 Blockers & Risks

- **✅ RESOLVED**: **Security Gap** - Added permission checks to all attachment routes
- **✅ RESOLVED**: **Inconsistent Permission Models** - Attachments now use same permission system as pages
- **✅ RESOLVED**: **Category-Based Access Missing** - Attachments inherit page permissions
- **Low Risk**: Configuration persistence across server restarts

### ⚠️ **Critical Conflicts Discovered**

**Issue #22 - Storage Location Permission Integration:**

✅ **FIXED**: Added authentication and permission checks to all attachment routes
✅ **FIXED**: Attachments now inherit page-level permissions
✅ **FIXED**: Consistent permission model between pages and attachments

**Remaining Work:**
1. ✅ **COMPLETED** - Storage Location Rules implemented with ACL-based decisions
2. ⏳ **Category Integration** - Add System/Admin category restrictions for attachments
3. ⏳ **Advanced ACL Syntax** - Add attachment-specific permission syntax
4. ⏳ **Audit Logging** - Add comprehensive logging for attachment operations

### 🎯 Next Actions

1. **Start next sub-issue** - Begin time-based permissions (#16)
2. **Add CSRF protection** - Secure the maintenance toggle endpoint
3. **Add maintenance mode logging** - Track maintenance mode changes
4. **Consider next sprint** - Plan the next set of features to implement
