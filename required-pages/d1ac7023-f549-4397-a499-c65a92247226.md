# Password Management Guide

## Local vs OAuth Accounts

amdWiki supports two types of user accounts:

### üîë Local Accounts
- **Username & Password**: Stored locally in the wiki system
- **Password Changes**: Can change password through profile page
- **Registration**: Available through `/register` page
- **Authentication**: Direct login with username/password

### üåê OAuth/External Accounts  
- **External Provider**: Managed by OAuth providers (Google, GitHub, etc.)
- **No Local Password**: Password is managed by the external provider
- **Password Changes**: Must be done through the OAuth provider's system
- **Authentication**: Via JWT tokens or OAuth flow

## Changing Your Password

### For Local Accounts:

1. **Access Profile**: Click your username in the top-right menu ‚Üí "Profile"
2. **Current Password**: Enter your current password for verification
3. **New Password**: Enter your new password (minimum 6 characters)
4. **Confirm**: Re-enter your new password to confirm
5. **Save**: Click "Update Profile" to save changes

### For OAuth Accounts:

OAuth accounts cannot change passwords through the wiki interface. To change your password:

1. Visit your OAuth provider's website (Google, GitHub, etc.)
2. Change your password through their account settings
3. The change will automatically apply to your wiki access

## Security Features

- **Password Validation**: Minimum 6 characters required
- **Current Password Verification**: Must provide current password to change
- **Secure Hashing**: Passwords are stored using SHA-256 with salt
- **Session Management**: Secure cookie-based sessions
- **External Integration**: JWT token support for OAuth providers

## Account Types

You can identify your account type on your profile page:

- **Local Account**: Shows "Local Account" badge and password change form
- **OAuth Account**: Shows "OAuth/External" badge with provider information

## Troubleshooting

### "Current password is incorrect"
- Verify you're entering your current password correctly
- Check if your account is a local account (not OAuth)

### "Cannot change password for OAuth accounts"
- Your account is managed externally
- Change password through your OAuth provider

### Password requirements not met
- Ensure password is at least 6 characters
- Verify new password and confirmation match

## Admin Features

Administrators can:
- Reset passwords for local user accounts
- Manage user roles and permissions
- View user account types and login history
- Create new local or external user accounts

For more help, contact your wiki administrator.
