# Attachments

amdWiki supports file attachments including images, PDFs, and other documents. Attachments are stored centrally and can be referenced from any page.

## Uploading Attachments

There are two ways to upload attachments:

### From the Navbar

- Navigate to any wiki page
- Click **More...** → **Upload Attachment**
- Select a file and add an optional description
- Click **Upload**

### From the Editor

When editing a page:

- Use the **Insert Image** section to upload and insert images
- Or click **More...** → **Upload Attachment** for any file type

## Inserting Attachments

### Insert from Browse

When editing a page:

- Click **More...** → **Browse Attachments**
- A popup opens showing all available attachments
- Click the green **Insert** button on any attachment
- The wiki syntax is inserted at your cursor position

### Manual Syntax

For images:

```
[{Image src='filename.jpg'}]
[{Image src='filename.jpg' caption='My Caption' align='left'}]
```

For other files (PDFs, documents):

```
[{ATTACH filename.pdf}]
```

## Image Plugin Parameters

The Image plugin supports these parameters:

| Parameter | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src` | Filename or path (required) | `'photo.jpg'` |
| `caption` | Image caption | `'My Photo'` |
| `alt` | Alt text (defaults to caption) | `'Description'` |
| `align` | Alignment: left, right, center | `'left'` |
| `display` | Display mode (see below) | `'float'` |
| `width` | Image width | `'300'` |
| `height` | Image height | `'200'` |
| `border` | Border width in pixels | `'1'` |
| `style` | Custom CSS styles | `'background: white;'` |
| `class` | Custom CSS class | `'my-class'` |
| `link` | URL to link to | `'https://...'` |

### Display Modes

| Mode | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `block` (default) | Image on its own line, no text wrapping |
| `float` | Text wraps around the image |
| `inline` | Image flows with text |
| `full` | Full-width image |

### Examples

Basic image:

```
[{Image src='photo.jpg'}]
```

Image with caption, left-aligned with text wrapping:

```
[{Image src='photo.jpg' caption='My Photo' align='left' display='float'}]
```

Full-width image:

```
[{Image src='banner.jpg' display='full'}]
```

## ATTACH Plugin

For non-image files, use the ATTACH plugin:

```
[{ATTACH document.pdf}]
```

This creates a download link with file information.

## Browsing Attachments

## Storage

Attachments are stored centrally in `data/attachments/` with:

- Content-based deduplication (same file stored once)
- SHA-256 hash naming
- Schema.org metadata
- Page mention tracking

## File Types

Allowed file types are configured by the administrator. Common defaults:

- Images: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, SVG
- Documents: PDF, Word, Excel, text files
- Maximum size: 10MB (configurable)

## Cross-Page References

Attachments can be referenced from any page. The system automatically resolves filenames to the correct attachment URL.
