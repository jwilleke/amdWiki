# Markdown Footnotes Example

This page demonstrates the GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) footnote syntax now supported in amdWiki.

## Basic Footnote

Footnotes allow you to add notes and references without cluttering the main text[^1]. You can reference them using a simple syntax.

## Multiple Footnotes

You can have multiple footnotes in a single document[^2]. Each footnote is automatically numbered sequentially in the output[^3].

## Footnote Identifiers

Footnotes can use numeric identifiers like `[^1]` or text identifiers like `[^my-note]`[^my-note].

## Multi-Paragraph Footnotes

Footnotes can contain multiple paragraphs or code blocks[^long-note].

## Usage in Technical Documentation

Footnotes are particularly useful for:

- **Citations**: Adding references to external sources[^4]
- **Clarifications**: Providing additional context without interrupting the flow
- **Technical Details**: Including implementation notes for developers[^technical]
- **Legal Disclaimers**: Adding legal text without cluttering the main content

## Syntax Reference

### Footnote Reference

Place a footnote reference in your text where you want the link to appear:

```markdown
This is some text with a footnote[^1].
```

### Footnote Definition

Place the definition anywhere in your document (typically at the end):

```markdown
[^1]: This is the footnote text.
```

### Multi-Paragraph Footnotes

For footnotes with multiple paragraphs, indent continuation lines with 4 spaces:

```markdown
[^long-note]: This is the first paragraph.

    This is the second paragraph, indented with 4 spaces.

    ```
    This is a code block within a footnote.
    ```
```

## Benefits

Using footnotes provides several benefits:

1. Cleaner, more readable main text
2. Organized references at the bottom of the page
3. Automatic numbering
4. Bidirectional links (click to jump to footnote, click to return to text)

## Footnote Definitions

[^1]: This is a simple footnote. It provides additional information without cluttering the main text.

[^2]: This is the second footnote. Notice how they are automatically numbered in order of appearance.

[^3]: Footnotes are numbered sequentially based on the order they appear in the document, not the order of their identifiers.

[^my-note]: This footnote uses a text identifier instead of a number. The output still shows it as a sequential number.

[^long-note]: This is a longer footnote with multiple paragraphs.

    This is the second paragraph of the footnote. It must be indented by 4 spaces or one tab to be included in the same footnote.

    You can include code blocks, lists, and other markdown elements within footnotes:

    - Item 1
    - Item 2
    - Item 3

[^4]: For example: Smith, J. (2024). "Markdown Best Practices." Journal of Documentation, 15(3), 234-256.

[^technical]: The footnote feature is implemented using the `showdown-footnotes` extension, which provides GitHub Flavored Markdown compatible footnote syntax. The extension is integrated into the RenderingManager at initialization time.
