# User Roles and Permissions

amdWiki implements a role-based access control (RBAC) system that defines what actions users can perform within the wiki. This system provides fine-grained permission control while maintaining simplicity for [Administrator].

## Available Roles and Permissions
[Roles] and the [Permissions] each [Role] are defined in [Configuration System] as [Access Control Policies]

[{ConfigAccessor type='roles'}]

## Permission Categories

[{ConfigAccessor type='actions'}]

### Display All Actions (Permissions)

[{ConfigAccessor type='actions' valueonly='true' before='* ' after='\n'}]

## Role Assignment

### Current User Assignments

Current User Assignments are available at [Security Policy Management|/admin/roles] (admin permission required)
Typically display similar to:
- **admin** user: `admin` role
- **jim** user: `reader` role

### Changing User Roles
1. [Access user management|/admin/users|target='_blank'] (admin permission required)
2. Select target user
3. Assign appropriate role from available options
4. Changes take effect immediately

## Integration with ACLs

Roles work seamlessly with [Access Control Lists](Access%20Control%20Lists.md):

- **Role-based ACLs**: Use role names in ACL definitions
- **Admin Override**: Admin users bypass all ACL restrictions
- **Hierarchical Access**: Higher roles typically include lower role permissions
- **Default Behavior**: When no ACL exists, role permissions apply

### Example ACL with Roles

```

## Built-in Principals

Beyond user roles, the system recognizes these special principals:

- **all** - Everyone (authenticated and anonymous)
- **anonymous** - Users without authentication
- **asserted** - Users with session but not authenticated
- **authenticated** - Users with valid authentication

## Security Model

### Design Principles
- **Least Privilege**: Users receive minimum necessary permissions
- **Role Hierarchy**: Clear progression from anonymous to admin
- **Permission Granularity**: Fine-grained control over specific actions
- **ACL Override**: Page-level security can restrict role permissions

### Security Features
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Permission inheritance through role hierarchy
- ACL integration for page-level security
- Admin bypass capability for system maintenance

## Best Practices

### Role Assignment Guidelines
1. **Start Minimal**: Assign the lowest role that meets user needs
2. **Regular Review**: Periodically audit role assignments
3. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Avoid unnecessary elevated permissions
4. **Document Changes**: Track role changes for security auditing

### Content Security
1. Use ACLs for sensitive pages
2. Combine roles with ACLs for layered security
3. Regular security reviews of page permissions
4. Monitor admin activities

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Access Denied**: Check user role and page ACLs
- **Missing Permissions**: Verify role includes required permissions
- **ACL Conflicts**: Ensure ACL principals match user roles

### Debugging
1. Check user's assigned role in user management
2. Verify role permissions match required actions
3. Review page ACLs for conflicts
4. Test with admin account to isolate issues
