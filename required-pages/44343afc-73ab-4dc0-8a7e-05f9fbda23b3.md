# System Categories

[{$pagename}] defines the available categories for organizing wiki pages. Categories are **storage-based** and determine where pages are stored and how they're managed during upgrades.

## [{$pagename}] Details
 [{$pagename}] is part of [Page Metadata Documentation]  in 
```json
"_comment_systemCategories": "System category definitions with storage location mapping",
```
[{$pagename}] are validated by [ValidationManager]

[{$pagename}] are Managed through ConfigurationManager by Administrators.

## Storage-Based Categories

### `/pages/` - User Content
* **general** - User-generated content and personal pages
  * Storage: `/pages/`
  * Upgrade: Always preserved
  * Examples: Welcome, project notes, meeting minutes

### `/required-pages/` - System & Documentation  
* **System** - System-level pages required for wiki operation
  * Storage: `/required-pages/`
  * Upgrade: App-managed, may be replaced
  * Examples: Categories, PageIndex, User Keywords

* **Documentation** - User documentation and examples  
  * Storage: `/required-pages/`
  * Upgrade: Updated with app, tied to "Wiki Documentation"
  * Examples: Wiki Documentation, help pages, user guides

### `/docs/` - Developer Content
* **Developer** - Developer documentation and technical guides
  * Storage: `/docs/`
  * Upgrade: Versioned with app development
  * Examples: API docs, CONTRIBUTING.md, architecture guides

## Content Classification Strategy

### Primary Classification: Storage Location
The `category` field determines:
1. **File storage location** (`/pages/`, `/required-pages/`, `/docs/`)
2. **Upgrade behavior** (preserved, replaced, versioned)
3. **Management responsibility** (user, app, developer)

### Secondary Classification: Content Details  
Use `user-keywords` for detailed content tagging:
* `api`, `reference`, `tutorial`, `meeting`, `project`, `planning`
* Multiple  keywords per page for rich content classification ("amdwiki.maximum.user-keywords:")
* Searchable and filterable without affecting storage

## Category Usage Guidelines

* **Choose by storage needs**: Where should this page live?
* **general**: Most user content goes here (`/pages/`)
* **system**: Only for app-required operational pages
* **documentation**: User-facing help and examples
* **developer**: Technical implementation documentation
* **Details via keywords**: Use `user-keywords` for content specifics
