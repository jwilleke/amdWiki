# Red Link Test Page

This page tests the red link functionality for non-existent pages.

## Existing Links (should be blue)
* [Plugin Test] - This page exists
* [Third Page] - This page exists  
* [Test-5] - This page exists

## Non-Existent Links (should be red)
* [About this Wiki] - This page doesn't exist yet
* [News] - This page doesn't exist yet
* [Recent Changes] - This page doesn't exist yet
* [WikiEtiquette] - This page doesn't exist yet
* [System Info] - This page doesn't exist yet
* [Page Index] - This page doesn't exist yet
* [Undefined Pages] - This page doesn't exist yet
* [Unused Pages] - This page doesn't exist yet

## Mixed Example
Here's some text with both [Plugin Test] (existing) and [Non-Existent Page] (should be red).

When you click on a red link, it should take you to the edit page for that page with the page name pre-filled.
