## Backend Parsing Notes

The backend parses this file to populate the User Keywords selection in the UI:
- Only the list under `## [{$pagename}] Current Values` is used for UI population.
- The backend reads each bullet point (lines starting with `- `) as a valid user keyword.
- Other sections (Actions, Usage Rules, tables) are for documentation and do not affect keyword selection.
- Changes to the list are reflected in the UI after a reload or index rebuild.
