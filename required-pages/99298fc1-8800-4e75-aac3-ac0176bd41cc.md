# User Variables Test Page

This page demonstrates the new authentication-aware system variables that show different content based on the current user's authentication state.

## Current User Information

- **Username**: [{$username}]
- **Login Status**: [{$loginstatus}]
- **Current Page**: [{$pagename}]

## Authentication Status Explanation

The `[{$loginstatus}]` variable shows one of three states:

1. **Anonymous** - User is not logged in
2. **Asserted** - User has a session cookie but is not authenticated
3. **Authenticated** - User is properly logged in with credentials

## User Display Names

The `[{$username}]` variable shows:

- "Anonymous" for non-authenticated users
- Display name (if available) or username for authenticated users
- "Asserted User" or display name for asserted users

## Live Test

Refresh this page after logging in or out to see how the variables change!

**Current Status**: You are currently [{$loginstatus}] as [{$username}].

## Technical Details

These variables are implemented in the RenderingManager and are context-aware:

- They work in all page content (pages, footer, left menu)
- They respect the current request's authentication state
- They are safely handled when user context is not available

## Other System Variables

For comparison, here are some non-authentication variables:

- **Application**: [{$applicationname}]
- **Version**: [{$version}]
- **Date**: [{$date}]
- **Time**: [{$time}]
- **Total Pages**: [{$totalpages}]
