# Page Level Access Control Lists

[{$applicationname}] supports page-level access control using ACLs (Access Control Lists) to restrict who can view, edit, or manage individual pages.

## Overview

ACLs allow you to:
- Restrict page viewing to specific users or roles
- Control who can edit a page
- Set different permissions for different actions

## ACL Syntax

ACLs are defined in the page frontmatter using the `acl` property:

```yaml
---
title: My Protected Page
acl:
  view: [admin, editors]
  edit: [admin]
  delete: [admin]
---
```

## Permission Types

| Permission | Description |
| `view` | Who can read the page content |
| `edit` | Who can modify the page |
| `delete` | Who can delete the page |
| `comment` | Who can add comments (if enabled) |
| `upload` | Who can upload attachments |

## Principals

Principals are the users or groups that can be granted permissions:

### Built-in Roles
- `admin` - Full administrative access
- `authenticated` - Any logged-in user
- `anonymous` - Anyone (including guests)
- `all` - Everyone (same as anonymous)

### Custom Roles
Custom roles can be defined in the [User Roles and Permissions] configuration.

## Examples

### Admin-Only Page
Only administrators can view or edit:
```yaml
acl:
  view: [admin]
  edit: [admin]
```

### Public View, Restricted Edit
Anyone can view, only admins can edit:
```yaml
acl:
  view: [all]
  edit: [admin]
```

### Team Collaboration
Multiple roles with different access:
```yaml
acl:
  view: [authenticated]
  edit: [editors, admin]
  delete: [admin]
```

### Documentation Pages
System documentation (protected from casual editing):
```yaml
system-category: documentation
acl:
  view: [all]
  edit: [admin]
```

## Inheritance

Pages can inherit ACLs from:
1. **Parent page** - If in a hierarchy
2. **Category defaults** - Based on system-category
3. **Global defaults** - Site-wide fallback

## Checking Permissions

The [ACLManager] evaluates permissions in this order:
1. Page-specific ACL
2. Category-based rules
3. Default site permissions
