# Overview
[{$pagename}] provide dynamic, context-sensitive values in wiki pages.

## Pre-defined [{$pagename}]
Pre-defined [{$pagename}] are shown by the:
[{VariablesPlugin}]

[{$applicationname}] also defines all kinds of other [{$pagename}], and [JSPWikiTags] and [JSPWikiPlugins] can also add their own.  For example, see the [[$Counter] plugin.  

The following [{$pagename}] are pre-defined by JSPWiki: [{$Counter}]

## Page Level [{$pagename}] 

[Page Level WikiVariables]

You can use the "SET" directive to define a  that exists only in the page.

For example:

``` test
  [[{SET foo='bar'}]
```
creates a  called "foo", which has the value of "bar".  You can access this value anywhere on your page by using the shorthand "[[[[{$foo}]".
