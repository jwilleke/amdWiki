# System Variables Documentation

System variables are dynamic placeholders that get automatically replaced with current system information when pages are rendered. They use JSPWiki-style syntax with square brackets and curly braces.

## Notes

- Variables are expanded during page rendering
- Changes to system state (like version updates) are reflected immediately
- Variables work in all markdown content including frontmatter
- HTML content in variables is properly escaped for security

This system provides a powerful way to keep your wiki content current and consistent!
