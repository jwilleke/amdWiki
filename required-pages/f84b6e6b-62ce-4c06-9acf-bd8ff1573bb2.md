# Required Pages Sync

The **Required Pages Sync** page (`/admin/required-pages`) compares the built-in `required-pages/` source files shipped with amdWiki against the live wiki pages and allows administrators to synchronize them.

## Overview

Required pages are pages that amdWiki ships with — documentation pages, plugin reference pages, and system pages. They are stored in the `required-pages/` directory in the application source and are the authoritative source for those pages. The sync tool detects when the live wiki has diverged from the source and provides tools to bring them back in line.

## Status Values

Each required page is shown with one of four statuses:

| Status | Color | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **Current** | Green | The live wiki page is byte-for-byte identical to the source. No action needed. |
| **Modified** | Yellow | The source file has changed since the live page was last synced. The live page is out of date. |
| **New** | Blue | The source page does not yet exist in the live wiki. It has never been synced. |
| **UUID Mismatch** | Red | A page with the same title or slug already exists in the live wiki but under a different UUID than the source expects. Reconciliation is required before syncing. |

## Actions

### Sync

Copies the source file from `required-pages/` into the live wiki pages directory (`data/pages/`). Applies to pages with status **New** or **Modified**.

- **Sync All New** — copies all new source pages to the live wiki
- **Sync All Outdated** — copies all new and modified source pages
- **Sync Selected** — copies only the pages you have checked

### Diff

Available for **Modified** and **UUID Mismatch** pages. Opens a side-by-side or unified diff view comparing the source file content against the live wiki page content. A full-page diff view is also available.

### UUID Mismatch Reconciliation

When a live page exists at the same title or slug as a required page but with a different UUID, two reconciliation options are available:

- **Adopt UUID** — keeps the existing live page content unchanged but renames the live file to use the source UUID. Use this when the live page content is acceptable and you simply want to align the UUIDs.
- **Replace with Source** — overwrites the live page content with the source file content and uses the source UUID. Use this when the source content should take precedence.

Both options resolve the UUID mismatch so the page can be managed normally going forward.

## Summary Badges

The top of the page shows badge counts for each status:

- **UUID Mismatch** count (shown only when mismatches exist) — always addressed first
- **New** count
- **Modified** count
- **Current** count
- **Total** source pages

## Source Location

Required page source files live in the `required-pages/` directory of the amdWiki application. Each file is named `{uuid}.md` where the UUID is the canonical identifier for that page. These files are checked into the application repository and updated with each release.
