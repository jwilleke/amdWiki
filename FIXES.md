# Bug Fixes and Improvements

## Page Creation Workflow Fix (2025-09-07)

**Problem**: When users navigated to edit a non-existent page (e.g., `/edit/new-page`), the system would immediately create the page file on disk using `createPageFromTemplate()`. If the user clicked "Cancel" instead of saving, the incomplete page file would remain on the file system.

**Root Cause**: The `editPage` method in `WikiRoutes.js` was calling `pageManager.createPageFromTemplate(pageName)` when a page didn't exist, which immediately saved the template to disk.

**Solution**:

1. **Added new method `generateTemplateData()`** in `PageManager.js`:
   - Generates template content and metadata without saving to disk
   - Returns a page object with `exists: false` flag to indicate it's template data
   - Allows the edit form to display template content without file creation

2. **Modified `editPage` method** in `WikiRoutes.js`:
   - Changed from `createPageFromTemplate()` to `generateTemplateData()`
   - File creation is now deferred until actual save action

**Files Modified**:

- `/src/managers/PageManager.js`: Added `generateTemplateData()` method
- `/src/routes/WikiRoutes.js`: Modified `editPage()` to use new method

**Workflow Changes**:

- **Before**: Navigate to `/edit/new-page` → File created immediately → Cancel leaves orphaned file
- **After**: Navigate to `/edit/new-page` → Template data generated in memory → Cancel leaves no trace → Save creates file only when confirmed

**Testing**:

- ✅ Navigate to `/edit/test-new-page` - no file created
- ✅ Cancel by navigating away - no orphaned files
- ✅ Save workflow still works correctly
- ✅ Existing pages continue to work normally

This fix ensures that page files are only created when users actually save content, preventing orphaned template files from cluttering the file system.

## Metadata Documentation Updates (2025-09-07)

**Added metadata to documentation pages**:

- ✅ Password Management.md - Added frontmatter with category "Documentation"
- ✅ FIXES.md - Added frontmatter with category "Documentation"
- ✅ Updated Wiki Documentation page with links to all documentation

**Metadata includes**:

- UUID for unique identification
- Category classification (Documentation, System/Admin)
- User keywords for search and organization
- Creation and modification timestamps
- Proper page titles

This improves page organization, searchability, and enables proper categorization within the wiki system.
