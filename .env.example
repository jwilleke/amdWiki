# amdWiki Docker Environment Configuration
# Copy this file to .env and customize as needed

# Host port mapping for Docker
# This is the port on your host machine that maps to the container's internal port
# Change this if port 3000 is already in use
HOST_PORT=3000

# To use a different port, change the value:
# HOST_PORT=8080

# To let Docker auto-assign a random available port, use:
# HOST_PORT=

# Container internal port (should match amdwiki.server.port in config)
# You typically don't need to change this
CONTAINER_PORT=3000

# Node environment
# Determines which config file ConfigurationManager loads:
# - production: loads app-production-config.json
# - development: loads app-development-config.json
# - test: loads app-test-config.json
NODE_ENV=production

# Example: Run in development mode on port 8080
# NODE_ENV=development
# HOST_PORT=8080
