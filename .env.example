# Environment Configuration Template
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your values
# Never commit .env - it should only exist locally

# Project Information
PROJECT_NAME="amdwiki"
PROJECT_REPOSITORY="https://github.com/jwilleke/amdWiki"

# Application
NODE_ENV=development
# Default port for amdWiki (matches Docker/k8s configuration)
PORT=3000

# PM2 Process Management
# Maximum memory before PM2 restarts the process.
# Large wikis (14K+ pages) spike to ~3GB during search index rebuilds.
# Set higher if you see unexpected restarts in PM2 logs.
# PM2_MAX_MEMORY=4G

# Storage Locations
# Two-tier storage splits operational data from bulk content:
#
# FAST_STORAGE — operational data: sessions, logs, users, search-index, config, .env
#   Per-instance .env lives at ${FAST_STORAGE}/.env
#   Custom config lives at ${FAST_STORAGE}/config/app-custom-config.json
#
# SLOW_STORAGE — bulk content: pages, attachments, backups
#   Can be a NAS, cold-storage mount, or large cheap drive
#
# For single-drive setups, set both to the same path (or leave as ./data default).
# Config values reference these as ${FAST_STORAGE}/sessions, ${SLOW_STORAGE}/pages, etc.
#
# Default (single drive):
FAST_STORAGE=./data
SLOW_STORAGE=./data
#
# Multi-drive example:
# FAST_STORAGE=/mnt/ssd/wiki/data
# SLOW_STORAGE=/mnt/nas/wiki/data

# Legacy alias (deprecated — use FAST_STORAGE)
# INSTANCE_DATA_FOLDER=./data

# Instance Config File
# Name of the config file to load from ${FAST_STORAGE}/config/
# Default: app-custom-config.json
# INSTANCE_CONFIG_FILE=app-custom-config.json
